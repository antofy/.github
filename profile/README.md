Unlike centralized exchanges like Binance or Coinbase, Metaegg Defi doesn‚Äôt hold your funds when you trade: you have 100% ownership of your own crypto.

**üí∏ Earn**
Earn MEGG and other tokens for free with super high interest rates.
Earn tokens with Pools
Stake MEGG & earn free tokens. It‚Äôs really that easy.
MEGG holders will earn tens of millions of USD worth of free tokens each week from major projects. New projects will join the party frequently, so you can earn more, for even longer.
Earn MEGG with Yield Farms
Stake LP tokens, and earn MEGG. You take on a little more exposure to market fluctuations than with the Pools but can earn a higher APR to offset the risk.
Earn Trading Fees
No farm? No problem. Even if your trading pair isn‚Äôt supported on the Farms page, you can still earn trading fees when you stake your tokens in Liquidity Pools (LPs).

Metaegg Defi makes making money fun.

# Game-Fi
Metaegg allows you to have a maximum of 2 AI companions (Human: Male, Female Animal: Male, Female) within the Metaverse & Gaming environment you can use it as a guide, gaming corrector, movie corrector, or as a friend. NPC NFT will be an AI companion and can be customized. It can also be used in the play to win battles (PVP & PVE) and can breed new NPCs.
There are and will be many gaming experiences within the Metaegg gaming environment. Many of them will have players compete with each other using complex strategies and tactics to attain top rankings or be rewarded with FGG (Game Token).

There will be countless unique NPCs that players can collect with varying body parts and appearances. Body parts will unlock abilities for NPCs that vary across games, they will have completely different values, benefits, and skills from one game to another. Body parts also have their own unique card art for players to collect.

# Fit-Fi
Users are equipped with NPC NFTs to earn tokens by moving. Fule is needed to earn Fast Get Good (FGG). Every 1-liter of Fule equals to 5 minutes of move & earn movement and Fule which ONLY starts replenishing after users acquire an NPC NFTs. 
To begin, users can select any NPC NFT of their choice and start earning.
Users will be able to see a statue on the screen showing either Walking or Running based on GPS/internet signal, or the user is not organically moving (i.e. using a car ). No FGG will be earned, and users will not lose Fule depending on the circumstance.
White - No GPS; Red - Poor GPS; Green - Strong GPS. Always make sure you have Fule before moving, as there is no token earning if you have zero Fule.
FGG will be paid out for every minute of movement, which is dependent on 2 factors:
Type of NPC NFT - Base FGG returns for each NPC NFT will be different.
NFT‚Äôs Efficiency Attribute - The higher the efficiency, the more FGG earned per minute.
Once Fule is depleted, users stop earning tokens.

# Social-Fi 
Credit Box is a loot box that is randomly dropped while you are moving & socializing in the metaverse. It contains MEGG.
Upon receiving a Credit Box, opening the box requires waiting and the countdown starts automatically. Once the countdown ends, they will be spending a small amount of FGG (a Base Cost) to open it. Credit Box countdown duration increases proportionately to its quality.
